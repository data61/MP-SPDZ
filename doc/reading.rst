Recommended Reading
===================

The following table lists papers relevant for every protocol supported
by MP-SPDZ. This is the same as the output when using ``--papers``
during compilation. If you prefer a more general yet comprehensive
introduction to MPC, we recommend `A Pragmatic Introduction to
Secure Multi-Party Computation <https://securecomputation.org>`_.

Further recommended reading extracted from the code can be found in
the following table. This mostly refers to higher-level protocols
based on the arithmetic blackbox provided by the protocols above. You
can use ``--papers`` when compiling a concrete program to find which
papers are relevant for a particular computation.
